Hi, I’m @fliano  


I’m interested in Programming mainly in C# and JavaScript with a little bit of love for c++ even though I don't really ever use it.  
I’m currently learning to program with usage of OpenGL and I'm looking forward to try to program some little Games (in VR even)  
Looking forward to program something for myself and my life and then not doing it is also a great passion of mine.
